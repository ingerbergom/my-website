**Some Things About Me**

Education highlights:

- For undergrad, I went to [Grinnell College](https://www.grinnell.edu/) and majored in music and gender and women's studies. 

- Then I studied music composition with [Michael Schelle](https://www.schellemusic.com/1.html) and [Frank Felice](https://www.frank-felice.com/) at [Butler University](https://www.butler.edu/). 

- Soon after that, I completed a master's in Higher Education at the Center for the Study of Higher and Postsecondary Education [(CSHPE)](https://marsal.umich.edu/academics-admissions/cshpe) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). Worked at the amazing [Center for the Study of Learning and Teaching](https://crlt.umich.edu/) for about a year, then attended CSHPE again, but this time as a PhD student.

- Lately, I've been taking a series of excellent computer science courses at Harvard's [Division of Continuing Education](https://dce.harvard.edu/). 

- I've also been on the teaching side of things a bit: I taught *Organizational Leadership and Management in Higher Education* at [Merrimack College](https://www.merrimack.edu/), and I'm currently a Teaching Fellow for [Carrie Conaway's](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/directory/faculty/carrie-conaway) [*Making Data Count*](https://beta.my.harvard.edu/course/EDUS057/2025-Spring/01) at the [Harvard Graduate School of Education](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/).
